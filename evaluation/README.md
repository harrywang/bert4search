## Industrial Classification Information 

There are three types of most common industrial classification standards:

3. __GICS__ (Global Industry Classification Scheme). 


The details of these three can be found online. In this paper, the classification information towards each company is collected through __Compustat - Capital IQ__ on Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS).
